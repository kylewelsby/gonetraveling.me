Located down a quiet alley right behind The Summer Hotel is White Lion Hotel {{<tripadvisor 3158394>}}.

This little hotel is cheap and very very cheerful, we paid 300,000d per night half the price of a basic room in The Summer Hotel.

This hotel does not provide food or breakfast, but there are plenty of places around to get food.

The rooms are clean and comfortable with air-conditioning plenty of space.  The wash room has a glass separated shower area, the showers have great pressure (I love high pressure showers). Fast free WiFi is available in all rooms and throughout the hotel. However the air-conditioning is weak and doesn't fully cool the room, and the bathroom lacks a deep clean every so often (limescale on shower glass) - our only negatives.

The hotel has a elevator from basement to top floor, although the steps are shallow so very easy to climb the steps.

The staff are very friendly, yet they do not speak very good English - Google translate helps converse and resolve issues.  They always smile, greet you and always want to help - they don't bother you trying to sell there own tours or extra services.

We was presented with a mould like smell in the room - likely due to the fridge freezer compartment defrosting from a earlier scheduled power outage.

Would highly recommend this hotel if staying in Nha Trang on a budget.

Pros:

- Friendly staff
- Value for money
- Great shower pressure
- Quiet Location
- Rooms with window

Cons:

- Weak air-conditioning
- Limited English
