[Hotel Shakti](http://www.agoda.com/en-gb/hotel-shakti/hotel/kathmandu-np.html?cid=1649959 "Agoda: Hotel Shakti") was a comfortable enough stay.  Every-other day there is a large tour group passing though (some european youth group that all wear the same uniform).

The staff was very friendly, making our stay comfortable and assisting when needed. There was hot water most times which was very welcome to enjoy a long shower after a hot day.

The power was intermittent (going off 2 or three times a day). Television reception quality was not great, especially during a rain storm but there was a load of channels to flick through. The hotel has Wi-Fi and is available in the rooms, the Internet speed is reasonable, we upload all of our photos during the evening.

We had to stay at this hotel 2 more nights than intended because Kim was admitted to [CIWEC Clinic](http://gonetraveling.me/2014/07/ciwec-clinic/ "CIWEC Clinic Travel Medicine Center") following possible food poisoning at [Thakali Kitchen](http://gonetraveling.me/2014/07/thakali-kitchen/ "Thakali Kitchen"). We would have had to pay ₨3800 extra per night but Himalayan Encounters (the tour operator handling the Nepal section of our Tour) handled the bill as we lost enjoyment of our tour.

Hotel Shakti can be found north of Thamel, Kathmandu.
