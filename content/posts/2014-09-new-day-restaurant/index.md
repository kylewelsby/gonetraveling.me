New Day Restaurant on the corner of Mã Mây a few properties away from our hotel, which is really convenient.

This popular place to eat offers a great choice of delicious cheap food until late in the evening - we went most nights we could not bother searching for something new.

Most main dishes are between 65,000₫ - 110,000₫ and are plentiful and come with steamed rice which is very filling.
