We chose to stay for 7 nights at [Hotel Staywell DX](http://www.agoda.com/hotel-staywell-dx/hotel/new-delhi-and-ncr-in.html?cid=1649959) (ranked #84 of 813 on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g304551-d4154210-Reviews-Hotel_Staywell_Dx-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html)) to for our last hotel in India while we get our Vietnam VISA sorted.

The hotel is clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Staffs are friendly and speak enough English to get on by but advanced conversations or requests are could to be misunderstood.

Our room was small but comfortable with large mirrors, fully tiled bathroom and pleasant bright lighting. However the window opened to a dark shaft space, the room received no daylight (was difficult to figure out what time of day it was).

WiFi is fast, free and available in the rooms (note: password changes every day). Hot water is intermittent. Most days we had warm/cold showers. Television reception is great with plenty of news and movie channels (with many adverts)

The hotel restaurant is fan cooled and can get hot during the day (not pleasant to stay and work all day). The menu over complicated with dishes most that are never available. The food served is poor. Their biryani is a lot like fried rice, fried chicken portions are small for price (in my case undercooked too), Chow Mein is a boring large portion of no alternate food late night lazy food (except from Pizza Hut, McDonald's, or Domeno's)
