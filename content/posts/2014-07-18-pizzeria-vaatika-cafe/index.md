[Pizzeria Vaatika Cafe](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297685-d1203748-Reviews-Vaatika_Cafe-Varanasi_Uttar_Pradesh.html "Pizzeria Vaatika Cafe on TripAdvisor") (rated #27 out of 132 restaurants in Varanasi on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g297685-d1203748-Reviews-Vaatika_Cafe-Varanasi_Uttar_Pradesh.html "Pizzeria Vaatika Cafe on TripAdvisor")) overlooking the River Ganges we expected this place to be really good. It hosts a clay wood oven to cook the pizza's with. However the pizza was the most horrible pizza I have tasted. It tasted like the cheese was churned with Ganges water. I would never eat here again.
