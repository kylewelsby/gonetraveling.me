Pita is a Greek restaurant {{<tripadvisor 6652670>}} with a simple menu the food is of great quality.

I went here with my partner one evening as on occasion I do like the taste of Greek cuisine, Pita delivered! The gyros (meat, fries, tomato, onion, and teatziki sauc, is served and tastes just as it does in Greece. Such a pleasure to be treated to a nostalgic meal.

If you like kebabs, meat, pita bread, yoghurt etc YOU MUST EAT HERE!
