Pita is a Greek restaurant (ranked #3 out of 251 restaurants in Nha Trang on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293928-d6652670-Reviews-Pita_GR_Restaurant-Nha_Trang_Khanh_Hoa_Province.html)) with a simple menu the food is of great quality.

I went here with my partner one evening as on occasion I do like the taste of Greek cuisine, Pita delivered! The gyros (meat, fries, tomato, onion, and teatziki sauc, is served and tastes just as it does in Greece. Such a pleasure to be treated to a nostalgic meal.

If you like kebabs, meat, pita bread, yoghurt etc YOU MUST EAT HERE!
