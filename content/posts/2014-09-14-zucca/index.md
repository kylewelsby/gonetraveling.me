Zucca is a Italian, Vietnamese Restaurant {{<tripadvisor 3295650>}}.

We did not try any Italian food instead trying the grilled selection, and was pleasantly impressed. We had grilled chicken lemon grass skewers that are wonderfully seasoned and prepared with fresh ingredients, seasoned beans, and noodles.

You have to eat here.
