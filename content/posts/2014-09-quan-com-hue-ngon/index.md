We visited Quán Cơm Huế Ngon {{<tripadvisor 3811714>}} on a Friday night and luckily got a table. Very busy with locals no other westerners to be seen. The menu choice is extensive. We chose items familiar to us, chicken, prawns, beef, and pork. The portions are relatively small so many plates will need to be ordered to feel full enough (the chicken is just a wing chopped into 4 parts for 39,000 dong). Can see it easily mounting up in cost.

The place was packed out and there is only 4 staff to host the 20+ tables, it was difficult at times to get waiters attention.

Food is brought out to you, and you have to cook it yourself. The BBQ's are charcoal so you get a real good char on your food. The dishes are marinaded before being brought to you giving a great flavour.

It gets very smoky, expect your cloths to smell of BBQ afterwards. If you sit outside expect the odd street rat collecting your dropped food.

323,000dong our bill was, I would not mind visiting again but would not go out of my way.
