Recommended by our tuktuk driver, taken us to Mughal India Crafts & Textiles and shown the fabrics they stock.  As I ripped my shorts in Tordi Grah I could do with a sturdy new pair.

We were shown how hand printed fabrics were made (could watch these guys work all day)

I chose the same sort of cotton and colour, got measured up for my shorts that were made that same day. I paid ₹2100 for the shots that were made and delivered to my hotel.

A minor panic as the delivery of the shorts was a few hours later than stipulated. However they did get delivered and they fit very well.
