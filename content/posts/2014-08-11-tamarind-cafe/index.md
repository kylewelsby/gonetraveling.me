We visited Tamarind Cafe (rated #145 out of 856 restaurants on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d1124701-Reviews-Tamarind_Cafe-Hanoi.html)) which is next door to Tu Linh Palace Hotel 2.  Tamarind Cafe is a vegetarian restaurant with a relaxed couch atmosphere. We order spring rolls, both fresh and fried, the food tastes bland. I don't think this place is good value. We stayed for a while as the place has many plug sockets, good WiFi and relaxed atmosphere.
