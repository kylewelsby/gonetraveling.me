Lanterns is a Vietnamese restaurant {{<tripadvisor 1515355>}}, it serves a good choice of popular Vietnamese dishes, most impressive choice would be the BBQ. Choosing a choice of meats to be cooked on your very own BBQ at your table makes an interesting experience. The meat is nicely marinated before it is brought to the table. The food is of great quality and the service is friendly and talkative that complements a comfortable atmosphere.

Worth the visit.
