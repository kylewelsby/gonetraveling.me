[Kim](http://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk) suggested a highly rated [BK's Place](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293890-d1154232-Reviews-BK_s_Place-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html) {{<tripadvisor 1154232>}} for its Chips (finger fries they call them). We ordered a simple takeaway of Small and Medium Fries to devour back in our hotel room. These fries delivered!, crispy with brilliant seasoning by standard at a tasty ₨160 for small (about 98p).

We have since been a few more times and tried the Samosa's, this place gets fried food right!

Highly recommended!
