To get a crash course into Vietnamese food we could not turn down [Hanoi Street Food Tour](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d5583955-Reviews-Hanoi_Street_Food_Tour-Hanoi.html) {{<tripadvisor 5583955>}}. Reservation was made via email and we attended the tour the next day, starting at Kim building we visited many delights around Hanoi all accessible by foot. We were in a group of 8, who have traveled from England, and Australia.

We started at _Phở Gà Thanh Hợp_ with a bowl of "Phở Gà" (Chicken Noodles), we ate here a few days earlier and enjoyed it.  The chilli sauce they have as an extra is powerful, just a few drops transformed this dish.  At 39,000₫ (£1.10) this simple dish is cheap and cheerful.

We took a walk around the lake to _Bánh Cuốn Nóng & Mỳ Vằn Thắn_ to try shrimp rolls, the preparation method is impressive - using the steam from a pan to lightly cook a thin rice mixture and peeling it off, fill and present. Not sure how much this cost, was not to my taste.

We enjoyed refreshing cocktail drink in the shadow of [St Joseph Cathedral](https://plus.google.com/112769176198153719137/about)

I tried [Purple mangosteen](https://www.google.com.vn/search?q=Purple%20mangosteen), my new favourite exotic fruit along with [Pitaya](https://www.google.com.vn/search?q=Pitaya) not commonly available in the United Kingdom

We walked around the corner to _Quán Bánh Gối_ to enjoy the best spring rolls in town. By-far the best Hà Nội Spring Rolls we have tried!. Will defiantly visit again when in the area.

We finished the food section of the tour with Fresh Fruit and Yoghurt at _Shinh Tố Trang TríI,_ a great desert to the food we have tried.

A Hà Nội visit can not be complete without Bia hơi in the popular Hàng Buồm area, with rice crackers and many loud chants of cheers.

Still able to walk, we wend the tour with Egg Coffee, (yes coffee with egg) at _Cafe Giảng_.  We have nowhere to compare Egg Coffee with, but this place nails it! The egg is not a literal egg dropped into coffee, the egg is beaten with sugar until it is light and airy, then spooned on top of a good coffee blend.  Presented like a caffè latte this coffee is a brilliant way to end the Hanoi Food Tour.

Some of the group member called it a night, but we got along with some long-term travellers that well we decided to go for some more drinks. We talked all night about travel, and home life from the countries we are from. It was very refreshing to meet these people.

**Places we visited in order:**

{{<place ChIJXTOF7sCrNTERY3MOxYpAo_w>}}


This food tour cost us 424,000₫ per person, not entirely bad for the amount of places we tried. Would have preferred to try some less popular but still good Vietnamese Street food.
