It's such an alien feeling spending the holiday season over 10,000km (6,600 miles) away from my family. Actually this would have been the first Christmas I spent not dancing with Turkey and feasting on gorgeous food. However far I go I always think of home, I may not Skype that often as I would like to but it is nice to hear my mom, and dogs are still doing well, I do worry about my step dad Gary though.

A little over 6 months ago in July Kim and I left the comforts of Great Britain and arrived in Katmandu, Nepal. This is my first time outside of the European Union. We set a challenged to visit as many counties in Asia, and now we are on on country #6 - Malaysia.

5. [Thailand](/category/destinations/thailand)
6. [Malaysia](/category/destinations/malaysia)

I maintained good coverage and documented my travels, hotels and food until Cambodia, where it has since been a hindrance maintaining the blogging momentum. Getting into the mood to write has been difficult to get into - _as I'm writing this its 04:00 am and I've had difficulty sleeping for the last few days_.

I do intend to flex my memory muscles and back track events from Cambodia and Thailand.

Anyway I wanted to show you some highlights from the last six months of travel. I hope you enjoy.
