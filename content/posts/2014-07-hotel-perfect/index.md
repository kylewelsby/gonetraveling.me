We ended our guided tour of India at Hotel Perfect in New Delhi (The capital of India). Â The stay was not so perfect, the much needed air-conditioning unit did not work. The room was tired (needing some TLC). Wi-Fi worked, but only outside the room doors. Luckily we stayed here for only 1 night.

Only advantage to Hotel Perfect is it is in the perfect location for retail, loads of shops to buy cloths and stuff.
