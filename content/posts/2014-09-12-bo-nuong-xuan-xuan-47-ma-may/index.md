We regularly go to _Bò Nướng Xuân Xuân 47 Mã Mây_ {{<tripadvisor 2391034>}} for a simple cheap evening dinner that we can cook to our own liking.  You get given a BBQ griddle, a heap of meat and vegetables, a lime chilli & salt dipping sauce and can choose to add bread or rice. The BBQ grill's use smokeless fuel that lasts about 10-15 minutes, we usually have to ask for more fire (at no extra charge).

This all costs between 250,000đ and 300,000đ including a drink (less than £8.70).

Highly recommended for a good fill of meat.
