We checked into [Pratrap Bhawan](https://www.agoda.com/en-in/pratap-bhawan-homestay/hotel/jaipur-in.html?cid=1649959 "Agoda: Pratrap Bhawan") {{<tripadvisor 1018304>}} which is a convenient short walk from the [City Palace](/posts/2014-07-udaipur-city-palace/ "Udaipur – City Palace") and [Lake Pichola](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Pichola,+Udaipur,+Rajasthan+313001/@24.5702874,73.6729037,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3967e55f688ccabb:0xf1bf3b65d285cf6e "Lake Pichola on Google Maps"). The room we got was clean, and comfortable with a four-post king-size bed.  Hot water is always available, air-conditioning is powerful and there is cable television. Wi-Fi is not available in the rooms. We had the view of the lake and palace from our top floor window.

This accommodation is in connection with other local vendors such as Spice Box where we got Cooking Lessons.
