We have had a full series vaccinations recommended by our National Health Service for travel into Asia.

- [**Japanese Encephalitis**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/japanese-encephalitis/pages/introduction.aspx) - a type of viral brain infection that are spread through mosquito bites.
- [**Rabies**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/rabies/pages/introduction.aspx) - a very serious viral infection that targets the brain and nervous system.
- [**Hepatitis A**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-a/pages/introduction.aspx) - a type of viral liver infection.
- [**Hepatitis B**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hepatitis-b/pages/introduction.aspx) - a type of virus that can infect the liver.
- [**Yellow fever**](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Yellow-fever/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - a serious viral infection that's usually spread by a type of mosquito known as the Aedes aegypti mosquito.
- [**Typhoid fever**](https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Typhoid-fever/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs.
- [**Diphtheria**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diphtheria/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - a contagious bacterial infection that mainly affects the nose and throat. Less commonly, it can also affect the skin.
- [**Polio**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polio-and-post-polio-syndrome-/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - a virus that attacks the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis of muscles.
- [**Tetanus**](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Tetanus/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - a serious but rare infection caused by bacteria.

We got **Hepatyrix** (hepatitis A and typhoid vaccine), and **Repevax** (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping-cough, polio vaccine) free from the NHS, other vaccinations we had to pay for cheapest place we could find on short notice was [SuperDrug](https://onlinedoctor.superdrug.com/travel/clinic/manchester.html) spending **Â£521 each** on vaccinations.

Most injections where painless, except the ones we received from the NHS. The Hepatyrix and Repevax gave us minor sore arms after injection, the pain had gone after a few days. We believe the pain to be caused by the speed of the injection it's self.

Sore arms and a few hundred pounds is a minor price to pay for piece of mind for these deceased and viruses we could introduce ourselves to.

Would recommend everybody to ensure they have the correct vaccinations for the places they intend to visit, you can never know what you'll be exposed to.
