We stopped for lunch at [Aranyawas](https://www.tripadvisor.in/Hotel_Review-g1162449-d734784-Reviews-Aranyawas-Ranakpur_Rajasthan.html).  Ordered Chicken Sandwich and French Fries (a order which should be simple enough anywhere). It was awful, the French Fries tasted like they were re-fried from the last nights batch. The chicken sandwich had a small amount of chicken in bread only, and the chicken was awful tasting itself.

Overall not a great place to eat, would recommend to "keep on driving".
