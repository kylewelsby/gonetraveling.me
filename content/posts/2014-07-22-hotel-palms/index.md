[Hotel Palms](http://www.agoda.com/en-in/hotel-palms-jaipur/hotel/jaipur-in.html?cid=1649959 "Agoda: Hotel Palms") is a basic hotel in Jaipur. The hotel did not hot running water, and weak connection wi-fi was only available in the lobby.  Staff service were difficult to communicate with.

The hotel was difficult to navigate, it seems there was three hotels connected together via sky tunnels. Could not find the gardens or pool pictured on the website.

A basic stay in Jaipur.

Rooms cost about ₹1799 per night on [Agoda](http://www.agoda.com/en-in/hotel-palms-jaipur/hotel/jaipur-in.html?cid=1649959 "Agoda: Hotel Palms").
