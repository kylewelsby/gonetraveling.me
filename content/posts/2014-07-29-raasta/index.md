Raasta is a Caribbean Lounge in the Haus Khas Village, New Delhi {{<tripadvisor 4267971>}}.  We had drinks, and food. The atmosphere was fun until karaoke started.  The prices seemed a bit overpriced for India, especially after calculating Tax and Service Charge, that aside I likely would go again for quiet late afternoon drinks.
