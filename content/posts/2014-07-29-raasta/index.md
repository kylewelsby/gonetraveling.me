Raasta is a Caribbean Lounge in the Haus Khas Village, New Delhi (rated #493 out of 3597 restaurants in New Delhi on [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g304551-d4267971-Reviews-Raasta_The_Caribbean_Lounge-New_Delhi_National_Capital_Territory_of_Delhi.html)).  We had drinks, and food. The atmosphere was fun until karaoke started.  The prices seemed a bit overpriced for India, especially after calculating Tax and Service Charge, that aside I likely would go again for quiet late afternoon drinks.
