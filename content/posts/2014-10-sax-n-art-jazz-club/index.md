While in Ho Chi Minh City, we invited our hosts out for an evening of cocktails and music at Sax n Art Jazz Club {{<tripadvisor 2435381>}}.

We arrived just in time to get a table, order some drinks and listen to the live Jazz performances. The layout is interesting with the side-on stage, and cool lighting. I had high expectations to have a breathtaking experience of beautiful, unique, exciting, energising music. I think my expectations where a little to high.

I have not had a great deal of live Jazz performances, but I would personally say the music was ‘just played’. The performers did not look or sound like they really grooved together, instead just playing the same songs I assume they play every night. It is a shame when I think highly of live music and really enjoy it when performers really enjoy themselves, and express there joy through the music. This is however my personal opinion about the performances as a whole, this is not to dismiss the performers themselves they can play, its something they have dedicated a lot of there own time and passion to and its something I can not do.

At the mid-time break, we decided to call it a night.
