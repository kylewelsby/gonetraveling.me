Olina Hotel {{<tripadvisor 3370587>}} is a budget hotel, after checking reviews for all hotels within our price range this hotel yields less problems.

The hotel is noisy by other guests and outside construction.

The rooms are large with simple mini bar old CRT television and tiled bathroom. They look tired and would benefit painting, the desk is MDF and has water ring marks which is common for this type of wood. The sheets felt clean but still have stains on them, they need bleaching or replacing - this did not bother us much as we have a silk liner that we sleep within. There are no sheet covers except thick blankets in the wardrobe (which we decided not to use).

Hot water is mostly available but will completely stop when the main tank is empty. Like most Vietnam hotels the shower is over the bath and there are gaps around the bath, water does leak onto the main floor.

Mosquito's can get into the room as the balcony doors do not close flush (I got bitten twice during the night). The air conditioning may need a serving or something, it did not feel powerful enough.  Staff are OK, nothing to complain about. Note, you'll need to pay before staying instead of after the stay. Slightly uncommon for Vietnam. Breakfast is not included with the room price and it did not seem there was facilities or up-sell for breakfast.

We stayed two nights, that is all the time you need to explore the growing city of Da Nang.

The beach is a 3 minute walk away and is rather quiet compared to Nha Thrang.

Pros:

- Close to beach
- Minimal traffic location
- Cheap price

Cons:

- weak air-conditioning
- tired looking rooms
- noisy residents
- slow WiFi internet
- unhappy staff
