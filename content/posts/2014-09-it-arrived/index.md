I ordered the latest [Lonely Planet Southeast Asia on a shoestring](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1742207537/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1742207537&linkCode=as2&tag=gonetraveli02-21) book from Amazon.co.uk in hope it would arrive. Little to our despair the estimated delivery time came and gone, I started to worry that the book would not arrive in time for the next section of traveling.Luckily 2 days after the estimated date and 2 days we leave Hanoi, it arrives!

Super happy, I now have something to study on the train to Hu√© on Saturday.
