We visited Pukhraj Durry Udhyog for a few hours in the morning, having breakfast and shown how rugs are made by hand.  We loved the hospitality, the simple cooking, the brilliant flavour of the rice and pancakes. We seen a couple of rugs that taken our eye and could not resist to buy them.  \[youtube=http://youtu.be/6AJf03drNxQ\]
