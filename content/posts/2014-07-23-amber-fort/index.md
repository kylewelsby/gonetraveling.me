We visited Amber Fort in Jaipur (a grand fort kingdom that once held 20,000 residents).  This fort is remarkable to walk around, and discover hidden secret rooms. The view around is breathtaking, seeing the wall snaking up and down the hills.

There are many annoying pocket vendors trying to sell you stuff you disrupting your enjoyment of the place. As long as you have a good "GO AWAY" face you should have no problem.
