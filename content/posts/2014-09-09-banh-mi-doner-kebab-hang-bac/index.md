![](images/IMG_20140910_142216-1024x576.jpg)Bánh Mỳ (Bánh Mì) Doner Kebab on the intersection of Hàng Bạc and Hàng Bè. It serves seasoned pork cooked on a rotary for 30,000₫ a sandwich. Really popular as a "drive-thru", many motorcycles will pull up and ask a take-away. Highly recommended for a quick-lunch or sandwich on the go.
