We stayed at [Rawla Bagh](https://www.agoda.com/en-gb/rawla-bagh-nimaj-a-heritage-resort/hotel/jodhpur-in.html?cid=1649959 "Agoda: Rawla Bagh") for some village relaxation time, there is a pool and well-kept grounds to relax around.

The room we were given was huge, high ceilings with colourful decorative paint, have air-conditioning and hot running water. The power rarely failed.

We enjoyed staying here, highly recommended.
