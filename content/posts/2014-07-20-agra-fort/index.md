We were given a guided tour around Agra Fort, We learned how this fort wasÂ protected by a moat of crocodiles, a valley of tigers and a ramp of boulders and burning oil to stop any attacker attempting to take the fort. Apparently it was never attacked.

This breathtaking fort as a wonderful place to walk around and learn the luxuries kings and queens enjoyed.
