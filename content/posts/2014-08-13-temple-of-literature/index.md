While in the area near to the [Embassy of Kingdom of Thailand]( http://gonetraveling.me/2014/08/embassy-of-kingdom-of-thailand/), we went for an quick walk around the Temple of Literature. The architecture of this historical landmark is remarkable, if only I studies a little more into its meaning. A guide would have been a benefit, printed guide books are chargeable (we did not opt for). Still a nice place to visit.

Entrance fee is ₫20,000
