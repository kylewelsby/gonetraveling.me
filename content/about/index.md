Hello, I am Kyle Welsby a [Software Developer,](https://mekyle.com) [AmateurÂ Photographer](https://500px.com/gonetraveling) and [Traveller](https://nomadlist.com/@halfcube). I enjoy programming, tasting great food, seeing beautiful sights and understanding the world and universe. In 2014 my partner Kimberley (read her blog [Travel.Sleep.Repeat](https://travelsleeprepeat.me.uk)) and I sold our car, returned the flat to the landlord and [packed our stuff I to storage](/posts/2014-06-selling-up/ "Selling up"), booked our flights and started traveling. We have since come back to the United Kingdom, and still, explore the United Kingdom and Europe on shorter escapes. You can keep up to date on my social media;
